# Source code for the Tetris game.

To run:
`python3 tetris.py`

## Task
Write a better AutoPlayer than the one included with this source (random)

## Rules
 * You will only hand in your version of `te_autoplayer.py`, so don't depend on any changes you make to any other files.
 * You can only call functions in `te_gamestate.py`.
 * With each refresh in frame, a block can either rotate or move, but not both. 

## Controls

See the source code in te_controller.py

 * **a** - move left
 * **s** - move right
 * **k** - rotate left
 * **l** - rotate right
 * *space* - drop
 * **y** - toggle autoplay
 * **q** - quit
 * **r** - restart
